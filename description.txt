This branch contains the updated codes to show more accurately how the codes should work in terms of its functionalities.

The python scripts for this branch contains time recording properties to check how much time is needed to run the whole setup.
There will be timings saved to csv files which can be used as reference for later on.

There is 3 VMs in the entire setup, keygen, client and cloud, which you can tell from the naming of the folders.
 
Add the files of each folder to its respective VMs.

To start the setup:

1) start AES_server.py on keygen then start AES_client.py on client
2) start AES_server_cloud.py on keygen then start AES_client_cloud.py on cloud
3) start Homo_client_alone.py on client then start Homo_cloud.alone.py on cloud
