The folder Dragonfly_SAE is for our interim report submission. It contains 2 files for the VMs to talk to each other.

The folders with "finalcodes_[xxx]" is for our submission in week 7, xxx will determine the different VMs where we put our codes.

keygen is key generator.

To test the final codes, 
1. run dragonfly_private.py on the keygen first then on client
2. run dragonfly_public.py on the keygen first then on cloud
3. run dragonfly_cipher.py on the client first then the cloud

The files with "Alice_[yyy].c" are the codes for homomorphic encryption that we have got from our seniors. These files will be called and runned when the initial connection has been established from the Draggonfly codes.



Cheers
